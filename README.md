## Introduction
This project aims to develop an autonomous robot utilizing ROS2, a differential drive mechanism, and YOLOv8 for instance segmentation. The robot is capable of navigating autonomously while detecting and segmenting objects in its environment.

## Features
- Autonomous navigation using ROS2
- Differential drive control
- Real-time object detection and segmentation using YOLOv8
- Environment awareness

## Hardware 
- Differential drive robot chassis
- Jetson Nano SBC (Single Board Computer)
- Camera module
- Hackerboard ESP32 based microcontroller
- Battery pack

## Software Requirements
- ROS2 Humble
- Python 3.12
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8
- Pytorch
